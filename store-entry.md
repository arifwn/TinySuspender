Unload idle tabs to free your precious memory and cpu resources!

Tiny Suspender will automatically suspend/hibernate background tabs for you, greatly reducing overall system resource usage without you having to take any action. You can set how long to wait before suspending idle tabs and configure a whitelist to exclude certain pages from automatic suspension.

Features:

- Form Detection: Tiny Suspender will try to detect active forms to avoid automatically suspending page with unsubmitted data

- Audio Detection (optional): prevent autosuspending tabs that play music in the background.

- Snooze: Temporarily prevent autosuspension on a specific tab or domain

- Whitelist: Excludes specifics domains, pages, tabs or pinned tabs.

- Keyboard Shortcuts: Suspend tabs without moving your hand away from your keyboard.

- Optionally use Chrome's native tab discard feature to save even more resources when your background tabs get suspended.

- Allow opening links in a new suspended tab

- Dark Mode theme (optional)
